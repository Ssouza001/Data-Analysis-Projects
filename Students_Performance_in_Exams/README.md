# 🎓 Students Performance in Exams

This project explores educational data from Kaggle to identify patterns in student performance based on **gender**, **parental education**, and **participation in preparatory courses**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order to answer:

- Does gender affect students' grades?
- Which demographic groups perform best across subjects?
- Do students with more educated parents tend to achieve better scores?
- Does attending a preparatory course positively impact performance?

---

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
The following relationships were investigated using visual exploration:

- Gender vs. Performance
- Parental Education vs. Scores
- Impact of Preparatory Course on Grades

---

## ✅ Key Findings
- Students who took the **preparatory course** consistently performed better in all subjects.
- Visualizations showed a **reduction in negative outliers** and **increase in medians** for this group, suggesting the course has a **positive effect on academic performance**.
