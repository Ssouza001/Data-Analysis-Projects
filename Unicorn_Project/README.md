# 🦄 Analysis of Global Unicorns

This project carries out an exploratory analysis of startups known as "unicorns" - companies valued at more than 1 billion dollars. The focus is on global distribution, predominant sectors and total market value by country.

## 📌 Objective

To investigate the global innovation landscape based on unicorn data, analyzing:
- The presence of null fields in the dataset
- The most representative sectors
- The concentration of unicorns per country
- The total market value per nation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis Performed

- Heat map of null values**: Identified the absence of data in the “Sector” and “Investors” columns, recommending specific treatment to preserve analytical quality.
- Ranking by sector**: Showed the predominance of companies in the areas of fintech, software, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and health.
- Distribution by country (pie)**: It showed that more than 60% of unicorns are in the United States, followed by China, India and the United Kingdom.
- Market value by country**: Reinforced US dominance in valuation, with strong asymmetry in relation to other countries.
